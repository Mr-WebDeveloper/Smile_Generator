TO run this file first you need to install nodejs on your machine.

Then open the code in your editor. I used VsCode.

Next open the terminal, (Shortcut) click ctrl + `

Then type npm i (or) npm install -> this is used to install the necessary libraries which are all used in this code.

Next install the nodemon globally by using this command -> npm install --global nodemon.

Then to start the server type nodemon index.js.

Then go to any brpwser and type localhost:3000

And finally the jokes are displayed, happy mode turned on.
